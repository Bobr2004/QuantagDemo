                        and/or your telephone number). Furthermore, the conference tools process the duration of the
                        conference, start and end (time) of participation in the conference, number of participants and
                        other "context information" in connection with the communication process (metadata). <br> <br>

                        Furthermore, the provider of the tool processes all technical data that is required to process
                        online communication. This includes in particular IP addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs,
                        device type, operating system type and version, client version, camera type, microphone or
                        loudspeaker and the type of connection. <br> <br>

                        If content is exchanged, uploaded or provided in any other way within the tool, this is also
                        stored on the servers of the tool providers. Such content includes but is not limited to cloud
                        recordings, chat/instant messages, voicemails, uploaded photos and videos, files, whiteboards
                        and other information shared while using the Service. <br> <br>

                        Please note that we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the tools
                        used. Our options are largely based on the corporate policy of the respective provider. Further
                        information on data processing by the conference tools can be found in the data protection
                        declarations of the tools used, which we have listed below this text.</p>
